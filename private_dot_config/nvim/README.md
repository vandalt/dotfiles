# My Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuration.

`init.lua` will install `mini.nvim` and setup `mini.deps`, which I use to manage my plugins.
Everything else is in the `plugin/` directory. Files in that directory are loaded in alphabetical order.

The `lua` directory contains lua code that will be used only if required elsewhere.
